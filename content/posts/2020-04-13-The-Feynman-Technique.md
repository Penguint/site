## 费曼学习法 The Feynman Technique

Scott Young makes a great job of explaining it, or Learning on Steroids as he charmingly calls it.

1. Choose your concept
2. Pretend your teaching it to a new student
3. Whenever you get stuck, go back to the books
4. Simplify wordy bits or create analogies

Written format is on [Scott Young’s website](http://www.scotthyoung.com/learnonsteroids/grab/TranscriptFeynman.pdf)

### Possible sources of the Feynman technique

> The Feynman Technique is laid out clearly in James Gleick's 1993 biography, "Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman." In the book, Gleick explains the method in terms of how Feynman mastered his exams at Princeton University: "He opened a fresh notebook. On the title page, he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject."

> Surely Richard Feynman's methods are so well known that no book is necessary. I believe it was Freeman Dyson who stated them -
>> You write down the problem.\
>> You think very hard.\
>> You write down the answer.
